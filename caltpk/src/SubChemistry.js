Litmus paper is a piece of paper that produces a result which can be used as a pH indicator.Litmus is mainly used to assess whether a solution is acidic or basic. The colour transition occurs over the pH range 4.5–8.3 at 25 °C (77 °F), with light blue litmus paper turning red under acidic conditions and red litmus paper turning blue under basic or alkaline conditions. Purple litmus paper is neutral.",

Different methods of separation are used to get individual components from a mixture.But, before separating any components from a mixture one must have sound knowledge of its physical and chemical properties so that separation can be done with ease,Sand, common salt and ammonium chloride form a heterogeneous mixture which can be separated easily through simple physical methods of separation In the mixture given ammonium chloride is a sublimating substance. On heating the mixture, sublimating substance directly changes into gaseous state, its fumes are collected and cooled to get solid sublimate To separate mixture of salt and sand following processes are used: Dissolve the mixture in water ==> as one substance is soluble and the other (sand) is insoluble,Sedimentation’ sand settles down at the bottom of the solution,Evaporation:The water from salt solution is evaporated by heating to get salt.",

Acetic acid is a monocarboxylic acid as it contains only one —COOH group.The oxidation of ethanol to ethanoic acid turns alcoholic drinks sour when exposed to air.Ethanol + Oxygen —> Ethanoic acid + WaterThis reaction occurs if wine, beer or cider is left out open to the air, it eventually becomes vinegar, not fit for drinking but it is very nice in salad dressing.Acetic acid is a weak acid and it ionizes only partially.Acetic acid is completely miscible in water to form homogeneous solution.In the chemical industry, ethanoic acid can be manufactured on a large scale by oxidising the alcohol named ethanol.",

        description:"Traditional soap is a product obtained by the hydrolysis of fats from animals and vegetable oils from plants.Soaps are molecules of sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acids.It has tadpole shape with long carboxylic acid chain, non-ionic (hydrocarbon) and ions attached to it like Na+.The ionic-end of soap dissolves in water while the carbon chain dissolves in oil.Soaps containing sodium salts are formed by heating fat (i.e., glyceryl ester of fatty acid) with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. This reaction is known as saponification.In this reaction, esters of fatty acids are hydrolysed and the soap obtained remain in colloidal form.It is precipitated from the solution by adding NaCl.The stearic acid molecule C17H35COOH or CH3(CH2)16COOH is a typical long chain fatty acid obtained from naturally occurring plant oils and used to make traditional soaps.The salt sodium stearate C17H35COO–Na+, formed when stearic acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide is a typical soap molecule.Only sodium and potassium soaps are soluble in water.Sometimes fillers are added to the soap to increase their value. For e.g., medicated soaps contain substances of medicinal value. Laundry soaps contain sodium rosinate for better lather formation. Perfumes, glycerol, etc. are also added.Generally, potassium soaps are soft to the skin than sodium soaps. These can be prepared by using KOH instead of NaOH.",

The normal boiling point of a liquid may be defined as the temperature at which vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to one standard atmospheric pressure (760 mm).The boiling point of a liquid increases if non-volatile impurities are present in it.",

        description:"When a system in equilibrium is suddenly disturbed, it will respond in some way until equilibrium is re-established.where [Fe(SCN)]2+, [Fe3+] and [SCN–] are the equilibrium concentrations of the respective species while K is the equilibrium constant. For a particular reaction the value of K is constant at a particular temperature. When concentration of any species involved in the equilibrium is disturbed, the concentration quotient,(a) Effect of increasing concentration of ferric ions. When ferric chloride solution is added to the red solution containing ferric ions, thiocyanate ions and ferric-thiocyanate complex, concentration of ferric ions increases and therefore, the concentration of thiocyanate ions should decrease or that of [Fe(SCN)]2+ should increase so as to keep concentration quotient equal to equilibrium constant at a given temperature. Therefore, increase in concentration of ferric ions results in more of thiocyanate ions combining with ferric ions to give more of [Fe(SCN)]2+ complex and therefore, the colour intensity of red-solution increases. Thus, increase in concentration of Fe3+ ions shifts the above equilibrium in the forward direction.(b) Effect of increasing concentration of thiocyanate ions. Since thiocyanate ion is in the denominator in the equilibrium law equation, the addition of more and more of thiocyanate results in more of ferric ions reacting with thiocyanate ions to give more of [Fe(SCN)]2+ complex. Hence, the colour intensity of red-solution increases. Thus, increase in the concentration of SCN– ions shifts the above equilibrium in the forward direction.(c) Effect of increasing the concentration of potassium ions. When potassium chloride is added to the red solution, concentration of K+ ions increases. It affects the equilibrium between potassium and thiocyanate ions.",
